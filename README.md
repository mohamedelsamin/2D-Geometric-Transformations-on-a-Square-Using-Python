# 2D-Geometric-Transformations-on-a-Square-Using-Python
This project demonstrates basic 2D geometric transformations on a square shape using Python libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib

## The transformations include:

1.Translation (moving the square to a new position),

2.Rotation (rotating the square around the origin),

3.Scaling (resizing the square).
